These integers represent the dimensions of a rectangular Theatre Square and the size of each square granite flagstone (a x a). The program should calculate and output the minimum number of flagstones needed to pave the entire Theatre Square, considering that the flagstones cannot be broken and their sides should be parallel to the sides of the Square.",

    "problem_statement": "Design a program to determine the winner of a card game called \"Berlogging\". \n\nThe program will be given an integer n (1 <= n <= 1000), which represents the number of rounds played in the game. Following that, it will receive n lines, each containing the information about a round in the format \"name score\". The name of each player is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, with a length between 1 and 32 characters. The score of each round is an integer between -1000 and 1000, inclusive.\n\nThe objective of the program is to identify the winner(s) of the game according to the following rules:\n1.
